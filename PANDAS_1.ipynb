       "  'body': \"In #61032 we have created a new base class `BaseExecutionEngine` that engines can subclass to handle `apply` and `map` operations. The base class has been initially created to allow third-party engines to be passed to `DataFrame.apply(..., engine=third_party_engine)`. But our core engines Python and Numba can also be implemented as instances of this base class. This will make the code cleaner, more maintainable, and it may allow to move the Numba engine outside of the pandas code base easily.\\n\\nThe whole migration to the new interface is quite a big change, so it's recommended to make the transition step by step, in small pull requests.\",\n",

Users are encouraged to migrate to [orjson](https://pypi.org/project/orjson/) which is both much faster and less likely to introduce a surprise buffer overflow vulnerability in the future.\\n\\nso it might be worth migrating to `orjson` during this development effort',\n",

       "  'body': '### Pandas version checks\\n\\n- [x] I have checked that this issue has not already been reported.\\n\\n- [x] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [latest version](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/whatsnew/index.html) of pandas.\\n\\n- [ ] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [main branch](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/getting_started/install.html#installing-the-development-version-of-pandas) of pandas.\\n\\n\\n### Reproducible Example\\n\\n```python\\nimport pandas as pd\\nfrom omegaconf import OmegaConf\\n\\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\"a\": [1, 2], \"b\": [3, 4]})\\ncfg = OmegaConf.create({\"cols\": [\"a\", \"b\"]})\\ncols = cfg.cols  # This is a ListConfig\\n\\ndf[cols] = df[cols] * 2  # Raises ValueError\\n```\\n\\n**Error message:**\\n`ValueError: Cannot set a DataFrame with multiple columns to the single column [\\'a\\', \\'b\\']`\\n\\n### Issue Description\\nWhen using an `omegaconf.ListConfig` object to select columns in a Pandas DataFrame, the assignment operation fails with a `ValueError`, even though the shapes, columns, and indices of the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) match perfectly. This behavior is unexpected and confusing, as it is not immediately clear that the issue is caused by the type of the column selector.\\n\\n## Expected Behavior:\\nThe assignment should succeed, as the shapes, columns, and indices of the LHS and RHS match.\\n\\n## Likely Context of Encountering This:\\nThis issue is likely to occur in workflows where omegaconf.ListConfig is used to manage configurations, such as specifying column names for normalization or other data processing tasks. For example:\\n\\n```python\\n# Compute min and max for normalization\\nmin_vals = data[target_cols].min()\\nmax_vals = data[target_cols].max()\\n\\n# Attempt to normalize using ListConfig as column selector\\ndata[target_cols] = (data[target_cols] - min_vals) / (max_vals - min_vals)  # This raises the same ValueError\\n```\\n## Workaround:\\nConvert the ListConfig object to a standard Python list before using it in Pandas operations:\\n\\n```python\\ndata[list(target_cols)] = (data[list(target_cols)] - min_vals) / (max_vals - min_vals)\\n```\\n\\n## Why This Is Confusing:\\n- The error message suggests that a single column is being assigned multiple columns, which is misleading.\\n- Shapes, columns, and even indexes match. Online there is no notes to be found on this edge case.\\n- The actual issue is the type of the column selector (ListConfig), which behaves like a list in many other contexts.\\n\\n## Proposed Solution:\\n- Improve the error message to indicate that the column selector type might be incompatible.\\n- Consider adding support for omegaconf.ListConfig as a valid column selector, since `isinstance(cols, Sequence)` is True. \\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nThe assignment should succeed, as the shapes, columns, and indices of the LHS and RHS match.\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\n\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\n------------------\\ncommit                : 0691c5cf90477d3503834d983f69350f250a6ff7\\npython                : 3.11.7\\npython-bits           : 64\\nOS                    : Darwin\\nOS-release            : 23.6.0\\nVersion               : Darwin Kernel Version 23.6.0: Fri Nov 15 15:13:28 PST 2024; root:xnu-10063.141.1.702.7~1/RELEASE_X86_64\\nmachine               : x86_64\\nprocessor             : i386\\nbyteorder             : little\\nLC_ALL                : None\\nLANG                  : None\\nLOCALE                : None.UTF-8\\n\\npandas                : 2.2.3\\nnumpy                 : 1.26.4\\npytz                  : 2025.2\\ndateutil              : 2.9.0.post0\\npip                   : 24.0\\nCython                : None\\nsphinx                : None\\nIPython               : 9.1.0\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\nbs4                   : 4.13.3\\nblosc                 : None\\nbottleneck            : None\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\nfastparquet           : None\\nfsspec                : 2025.3.2\\nhtml5lib              : None\\nhypothesis            : None\\ngcsfs                 : None\\njinja2                : 3.1.6\\nlxml.etree            : 4.9.4\\nmatplotlib            : 3.10.1\\nnumba                 : 0.58.1\\nnumexpr               : None\\nodfpy                 : None\\nopenpyxl              : None\\npandas_gbq            : None\\npsycopg2              : None\\npymysql               : None\\npyarrow               : 19.0.1\\npyreadstat            : None\\npytest                : 8.3.5\\npython-calamine       : None\\npyxlsb                : None\\ns3fs                  : None\\nscipy                 : 1.15.2\\nsqlalchemy            : None\\ntables                : None\\ntabulate              : None\\nxarray                : None\\nxlrd                  : None\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\nzstandard             : None\\ntzdata                : 2025.2\\nqtpy                  : None\\npyqt5                 : None\\n</details>\\n',\n",

       "  'body': '### Feature Type\\n\\n- [x] Adding new functionality to pandas\\n\\n- [x] Changing existing functionality in pandas\\n\\n- [ ] Removing existing functionality in pandas\\n\\n\\n### Problem Description\\n\\nUsers should be able to accessing a dataframe element–that is an Arrow-backed map–with normal python dict semantics.\\n\\nToday, accessing an *Arrow-backed* map element will return a list of tuples per [`as_py()`](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/3832e85779b143d882ce501c24ee51df95799e2c/pandas/core/arrays/arrow/array.py#L639) from [`MapScalar`](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.MapScalar.html) type–thus list semantics and not dictionary access semantics. Historically, this is because Arrow allows multiple keys, and ordering is not enforced. So converting to a python dictionary removes those two behaviors. (1) multiple keys *will* be removed and (2) the ordering *may* be changed. In practice, this is not the common case, and so it makes the common case hard. \\n\\nThe common case is that users want to interact with a map with traditional key/value access semantics. It\\'s often a burden and source of confusion when users need to manually convert, a la\\n\\n```\\n# pseudocode\\ndf = table.to_pandas(types_mapper=pd.ArrowDtype)\\nmy_dict = df[\"col_a\"].iloc[0]\\n\\nval = my_dict[\"key\"]  # error, no key/value access semantics\\nval = dict(my_dict)[\"key\"]  # users need to manually convert to a dict on each access\\n```\\n\\nThis behavior should also be available when using imperative iteration based methods like `.iterrows()`, which is another common patter for accessing element-by-element.\\n\\n### Feature Description\\n\\nWe can have a configuration for this in `ArrowExtensionArray`.\\n\\nArrow already has a `maps_as_pydicts` flag: [`.to_pandas(maps_as_pydicts=True)`](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.RecordBatch.html#pyarrow.RecordBatch.to_pandas) which controls this behavior *only* when *not* using pyarrow backed data frames (when using numpy backed data frames). This feature is already widely used in at last one large company.\\n\\nThe flag will generate a [native python dictionary](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/598938711a8376cbfdceaf5c77ab0fd5057e6c02/python/pyarrow/src/arrow/python/arrow_to_pandas.cc#L1026) instead of a python list of `(key, value)` tuples. This flag has also made its way to [lower-level apis](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/45471) and come up with [competing dataframe libraries](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/issues/21745).\\n\\nThere\\'s not an obvious place to put this in the `types_mapper` API. But, we can already see *unexpected* behavior when combining `maps_as_pydicts=True` with the `types_mapper=pd.ArrowDtype`\\n\\n```\\n# pseudocode\\ndf = table.to_pandas(types_mapper=pd.ArrowDtype, maps_as_pydicts=True)\\n\\n# my_dict is still a `MapScalar`!! \\nmy_dict = df[\"col_a\"].iloc[0]\\n```\\n\\nWhen combined, `maps_as_pydicts` is effectively ignored, because the code path taken for `types_mapper=pd.ArrowDtype` makes no use of the flag.\\n\\nSo, this is all to say, when we see both of those flags, we should *propagate the configuration* to Pandas, so that it will use it during element access [1](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/3832e85779b143d882ce501c24ee51df95799e2c/pandas/core/arrays/arrow/array.py#L634), [2](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/3832e85779b143d882ce501c24ee51df95799e2c/pandas/core/arrays/arrow/array.py#L639)\\n\\nSuch a change requires changes in both Arrow and Pandas.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Alternative Solutions\\n\\nAlternatively, we can save some state in the underlying pyarrow array, so that calling [`as_py()`](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/598938711a8376cbfdceaf5c77ab0fd5057e6c02/python/pyarrow/scalar.pxi#L1085) on the `MapScalar` will automatically do the right thing.\\n\\nSome breadcrumbs for context:\\n*  a `MapScalar` is generated when accessing a pyarrow MapArray [1](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/598938711a8376cbfdceaf5c77ab0fd5057e6c02/python/pyarrow/array.pxi#L1530C16-L1530C27), [2](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/598938711a8376cbfdceaf5c77ab0fd5057e6c02/python/pyarrow/scalar.pxi#L36)\\n* this is accessed when retrieving an element from an `ArrowExtensionArray` [1](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/3832e85779b143d882ce501c24ee51df95799e2c/pandas/core/arrays/arrow/array.py#L634), [2](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/3832e85779b143d882ce501c24ee51df95799e2c/pandas/core/arrays/arrow/array.py#L639)\\n\\nSo, one can imagine that this information is saved in the `MapArray`/`Table` itself. However, that also introduces action at a distance when converting a table to a dataframe, and then performing element access. It would be more straightforward to configure this during the conversion to Pandas and holding that configuration state in the dataframe.\\n\\n----\\n\\n\\nAnother partial alternative is making a `.map` [accessor](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/3832e85779b143d882ce501c24ee51df95799e2c/pandas/core/series.py#L5852). I lack context on these accessors and don\\'t know if they are an obvious solution, or a ham-fisted one.\\n\\n### Additional Context\\n\\nPerformance can be a consideration. When doing an element access, we\\'d be doing a conversion from the native `Arrow` array to a Python dictionary. \\n\\nHowever, *this is already the case*. Element access on a `MapScalar` already traverses the underlying `MapArray` and coverts it to a python list [1](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/598938711a8376cbfdceaf5c77ab0fd5057e6c02/python/pyarrow/scalar.pxi#L1112C30-L1113C1), [2](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/598938711a8376cbfdceaf5c77ab0fd5057e6c02/python/pyarrow/scalar.pxi#L1082)',\n",

When they do align, which value should be propagated.\\n\\nA few properties I think are crucial:\\n\\n- Alignment should only depend on value and left-vs-right operand, not storage.\\n- Alignment should be transitive.\\n\\nIf we do decide on aligning between different values, a natural order is `None < NaN < NA`.

But IMHO it should be possible to skip the table check and creation altogether in the `pandas.DataFrame.to_sql()` call. \\nIt looks like it would be easy to add a `skip_table_creation: bool = False` argument to the `to_sql()` method, that would just skip the prep_table call in SQLDatabase.to_sql().\\nThe downside would be that pandas would not have the reflected information about target database types, but this could potentially be solved by passing a custom `sqlalchemy.Table` object?\\n\\nWhat do you think about this? Is this a direction that Pandas would like to go in, or do you think about the `.to_sql()` method more as a handy feature for ad-hoc operations, that should not be used much in production? Do you think it is better to write my own insert methods and not rely on `.to_sql()` for production use?\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nI expect that it will not try to create a table if it exists, or an option to skip table creation if I know that it does not exist.\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\n------------------\\ncommit                : 0691c5cf90477d3503834d983f69350f250a6ff7\\npython                : 3.11.3\\npython-bits           : 64\\nOS                    : Darwin\\nOS-release            : 24.4.0\\nVersion               : Darwin Kernel Version 24.4.0: Fri Apr 11 18:33:47 PDT 2025; root:xnu-11417.101.15~117/RELEASE_ARM64_T6000\\nmachine               : arm64\\nprocessor             : arm\\nbyteorder             : little\\nLC_ALL                : None\\nLANG                  : None\\nLOCALE                : None.UTF-8\\n\\npandas                : 2.2.3\\nnumpy                 : 1.26.4\\npytz                  : 2024.2\\ndateutil              : 2.8.2\\npip                   : 24.0\\nCython                : None\\nsphinx                : None\\nIPython               : 8.21.0\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\nbs4                   : 4.12.3\\nblosc                 : None\\nbottleneck            : None\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\nfastparquet           : None\\nfsspec                : 2024.3.1\\nhtml5lib              : 1.1\\nhypothesis            : None\\ngcsfs                 : None\\njinja2                : 3.1.3\\nlxml.etree            : 5.1.0\\nmatplotlib            : 3.10.1\\nnumba                 : None\\nnumexpr               : None\\nodfpy                 : None\\nopenpyxl              : 3.1.2\\npandas_gbq            : None\\npsycopg2              : 2.9.9\\npymysql               : 1.4.6\\npyarrow               : 15.0.0\\npyreadstat            : None\\npytest                : 8.3.3\\npython-calamine       : None\\npyxlsb                : None\\ns3fs                  : None\\nscipy                 : None\\nsqlalchemy            : 2.0.40\\ntables                : None\\ntabulate              : 0.9.0\\nxarray                : None\\nxlrd                  : None\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\nzstandard             : None\\ntzdata                : 2024.1\\nqtpy                  : None\\npyqt5                 : None\\n',\n",

When I excluded the first data or retained the first data, the results of the rolling calculation varied greatly. I used this case to attempt to reproduce this result. The operators I tested, Including df.rolling.std, df.rolling.skew, df.rolling.kurt. I don\\'t know what the reason is. I think for the df.rolling operator, this should be a bug\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nThe result of the rolling calculation, regardless of what the first one is, should the last few pieces of data not be affected by the initial data\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\n\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\n------------------\\ncommit                : 0691c5cf90477d3503834d983f69350f250a6ff7\\npython                : 3.13.0\\npython-bits           : 64\\nOS                    : Windows\\nOS-release            : 10\\nVersion               : 10.0.19044\\nmachine               : AMD64\\nprocessor             : Intel64 Family 6 Model 106 Stepping 6, GenuineIntel\\nbyteorder             : little\\nLC_ALL                : None\\nLANG                  : en_US.UTF-8\\nLOCALE                : Chinese (Simplified)_China.936\\n\\npandas                : 2.2.3\\nnumpy                 : 2.2.5\\npytz                  : 2025.2\\ndateutil              : 2.9.0.post0\\npip                   : 25.1.1\\nCython                : None\\nsphinx                : None\\nIPython               : None\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\nbs4                   : None\\nblosc                 : None\\nbottleneck            : None\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\nfastparquet           : None\\nfsspec                : None\\nhtml5lib              : None\\nhypothesis            : None\\ngcsfs                 : None\\njinja2                : None\\nlxml.etree            : None\\nmatplotlib            : None\\nnumba                 : None\\nnumexpr               : None\\nodfpy                 : None\\nopenpyxl              : None\\npandas_gbq            : None\\npsycopg2              : None\\npymysql               : None\\npyarrow               : None\\npyreadstat            : None\\npytest                : None\\npython-calamine       : None\\npyxlsb                : None\\ns3fs                  : None\\nscipy                 : None\\nsqlalchemy            : None\\ntables                : None\\ntabulate              : None\\nxarray                : None\\nxlrd                  : None\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\nzstandard             : None\\ntzdata                : 2025.2\\nqtpy                  : None\\npyqt5                 : None\\nNone\\n\\n</details>\\n',\n",

This behavior is deprecated, and in a future version of pandas the grouping columns will be excluded from the operation. Either pass `include_groups=False` to exclude the groupings or explicitly select the grouping columns after groupby to silence this warning.\\n  result = df.groupby(\"group\").apply(process_group)\\n```\\n\\n### Issue Description\\n\\nWhen using groupby().apply() with a function that modifies and returns the entire group DataFrame, a FutureWarning is raised in pandas >= 2.2. This warning notifies users that in pandas 3.0, the default behavior will change: the grouping columns will no longer be included in the data passed to the function unless include_groups=True is explicitly set. To maintain the current behavior and suppress the warning, users must pass include_groups=False.\\n\\nThis affects workflows where the function operates on the full DataFrame per group and expects the group keys to be included in the data automatically, as was the case in earlier pandas versions.\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nThe expected behavior is still what I want from the above example.
